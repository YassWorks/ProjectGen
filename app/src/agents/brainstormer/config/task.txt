Analyze the user's project description and extract the MAIN IDEA.

OBJECTIVE:
Identify the essential purpose or value proposition of the project in conceptual terms.

GUIDELINES:
- Focus on WHAT the project aims to accomplish, not HOW it is implemented
- Ignore technical details, specific features, or tools
- Emphasize the underlying problem being solved or the benefit provided
- Avoid buzzwords or marketing speak â€” be precise and conceptual

EXAMPLES:
- "A platform that connects [users] with [service/product] to solve [problem]"
- "An app that helps [target audience] achieve [specific goal]"
- "A tool to automate [task] for [industry/role]"

OUTPUT:
Write a single sentence (max 2) summarizing the main idea clearly and concisely.

---

Extract all technical specifications from the project description.

OBJECTIVE:
Parse and organize all implementation-related information.

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Identify technologies, programming languages, platforms, tools, and frameworks
- Include architectural choices, deployment environments, and performance constraints
- If a category is not mentioned, explicitly write "Not specified"

FORMAT:
- Target Platforms: [...]
- Programming Languages: [...]
- Frameworks: [...]
- Libraries/Dependencies: [...]
- Tech Stack Components: [...]
- Architecture/Patterns: [...]
- Technical Requirements: [...]
- Development Tools: [...]
- Other Technical Details: [...]

Generate detailed features and creative ideas for the project based on its concept.

OBJECTIVE:
Produce a structured list of relevant features, grouped by function and value, while remaining feasible given the implied tech.

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Brainstorm core, advanced, UX, and technical features
- Include integration ideas, user roles, and scalability options
- Consider technical feasibility based on any constraints provided
- Align your ideas with the main concept or problem being solved

IF CONTEXT IS LIMITED:
- Infer reasonable assumptions based on typical use cases in the domain
- Be creative but not speculative

FORMAT:
CORE FEATURES:
- Feature 1: [Description]
- ...

ADVANCED FEATURES:
- Feature A: [Description]
- ...

USER EXPERIENCE (UX):
- Feature X: [Description]
- ...

INTEGRATIONS:
- Integration with [service/tool]: [Why it helps]

INNOVATIVE IDEAS:
- Idea 1: [Description]

TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS:
- Consideration 1: [e.g. offline support, responsive design]

Analyze the project context to infer or identify the target audience.

TASK:
Describe the primary users the project is intended for, along with their needs, behaviors, and goals.

INSTRUCTIONS:
- Identify demographic, professional, or behavioral traits
- Consider user goals, pain points, and desired outcomes
- Be specific (e.g., "freelance designers managing client assets", not just "designers")

OUTPUT:
A concise 1-2 paragraph profile of the most relevant target audience(s).

---

Critically evaluate the project idea for gaps, risks, or flawed assumptions.

TASK:
Identify what might go wrong or what's missing from the current idea.

CONSIDER:
- Overlooked user needs
- Missing components or integrations
- Scalability or security concerns
- Assumptions that may not hold
- Competition or market saturation

OUTPUT:
A list of 5-10 potential pitfalls with a short explanation for each.
